## NOTE:: This is a Work in Progress!

Code Stage (name subject to change) is a Laravel and VueJS based application built to allow users to quickly spin up staging sites for WordPress themes, plugins, and Laravel applications.

The goal is to allow users to submit a repository to the site and have it give back a friendly URL that the user can then use to send to clients, friends, etc, to see and test the site.

WordPress Themes and Plugins will automatically be installed on the staging site.  Users will have the ability to, at any time, destroy these sites or update them from their repository (with the ability to select and change branches on the fly).
